How do I approach designing software?
My preferred approach in this course was to start with what I knew how to do and build from there.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project gave me much more confidence in working on projects with a larger number of dependencies and libraries. I was intimidated at first but eventually understood.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
I found the Milestone process to be a great way to slowly build up a finished project.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I felt that I gained some skills in working with code that I do not yet understand. I was eventually able to work on the parts I knew until I understood the rest.
How do I approach developing programs?
I usually approach developing a program by thinking of any similar work I have done in the past that can give me a head start on the structure of the program.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
A new strategy for me on this 3D scene was including new headers other than the default ones.
How did iteration factor into your development?
The milestone system is a type of iteration for eventually reaching a finished product that has many requirements.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
In the earlier milestones I had to focus on small changes to the existing functions but by the end of the course I could add my own functions without breaking the sample code.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science will hopefully help me reach my goal of becoming a software developer.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Up until this course I had no knowledge on how a computer renders objects and animations on screen. This will be helpful knowledge for any future projects with visuals.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Visualizations are key components of a large percentage of software projects. Having skills and base knowledge in this area will help me be a well rounded job candidate.
